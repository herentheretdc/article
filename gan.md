# title
This is a script to generate new images of human faces using the technique of generative adversarial networks (GAN), as described in the paper by Ian J. Goodfellow. GANs train two networks at the same time: A Generator (G) that draws/creates new images and a Discriminator (D) that distinguishes between real and fake images. G learns to trick D into thinking that his images are real (i.e. learns to produce good looking images). D learns to prevent getting tricked (i.e. learns what real images look like). Ideally you end up with a G that produces beautiful images that look like real ones. On human faces that works reasonably well, probably because they contain a lot of structure (autoencoders work well on them too).

The code in this repository is a modified version of facebook's eyescream project.
